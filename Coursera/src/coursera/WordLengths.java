Programming Exercise: Breaking the Caesar Cipher
Before attempting these assignments, you should type in, compile, and understand the example
programs from the lesson, including: 1) counting the twenty most common words from
Shakespeareâ€™s plays, 2) counting the resulting random rolls of dice (how many 2â€™s, 3â€™s, 4â€™s, etc),
and 3) automatic decryption of the Caesar Cipher using statistical letter occurrences.
Assignment 1: Word lengths
You will write a program to figure out the most common word length of words from a file. To
solve this problem you will need to keep track of how many words from a file are of each
possible length. You should group all words of length 30 or more together, and you should not
count basic punctuation that are the first or last characters of a group of characters.
Specifically, you should do the following:
â— Create a new class called WordLengths.
â— Write a void method countWordLengthsâ€‹that has two parameters, a FileResource
named resourceâ€‹and an integer array named countsâ€‹. This method should read in the
words from resourceâ€‹and count the number of words of each length for all the words in
resourceâ€‹, storing these counts in the array countsâ€‹.
â—‹ For example, after this method executes, counts[k]â€‹should contain the number
of words of length k.â€‹
â—‹ If a word has a nonÂ­letter as the first or last character, it should not be counted as
part of the word length. For example, the word And,would be considered of
length 3 (the comma is not counted), the word â€œblueÂ­jeansâ€would be
considered of length 10 (the double quotes are not counted, but the hyphen is).
Note that we will miscount some words, such as â€œHello,â€which will be
counted as 6 since we donâ€™t count the double quotes but will count the comma,
but that is OK as there should not be many words in that category.
â—‹ For any words equal to or larger than the last index of the countsâ€‹array, count
them as the largest size represented in the countsâ€‹array.
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
â—‹ You may want to consider using the Character.isLettermethod that
returns true if a character is a letter, and false otherwise. For example,
Character.isLetter(â€?aâ€™)returns true, and
Character.isLetter(â€?Â­â€™)returns false.
â— Write a void method testCountWordLengthsâ€‹that creates a FileResource so you can
select a file, and creates a countsâ€‹integer array of size 31. This method should call
countWordLengthsâ€‹with a file and then print the number of words of each length. Test it
on the small file smallHamlet.txtâ€‹shown below.
â— Write a method indexOfMaxâ€‹that has one parameter named valuesâ€‹that is an integer
array. This method returns the index position of the largest element in values.â€‹Then add
code to the method testCountWordLengthsâ€‹to call indexOfMaxâ€‹to determine the most
common word length in the file. For example, calling indexOfMaxâ€‹after calling
countWordLengthsâ€‹on the file smallHamlet.txtâ€‹should return 3.
First test your program on a small file, such as this simple file shown called smallHamlet.txtâ€‹:
Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Note this file has words that are:
2 words of length 2: My as
3 words of length 3: are And the
2 words of length 4: Laer give
1 word of length 5: winds
1 word of length 6: sister
1 word of length 7: benefit
2 words of length 8: embarkâ€™d Farewell
1 word of length 11: necessaries

Assignment 2: Caesar Cipher Two Keys Decrypt
You should start by writing the decryption method explained in the lesson that decrypts a
message that was encrypted with one key, using statistical letter frequencies of English text.
Then you will add code to be able to decrypt a message that was encrypted with two keys,
using ideas from the single key decryption method and the encryption with two keys method
from the program you wrote in the last lesson.
Idea for two keys decrypt method.â€‹Recall that in using two keys, key1â€‹and key2,â€‹key1â€‹was
used to encrypt every other character, starting with the first, of the String, and key2â€‹was used to
encrypt every other character, starting with the second. In order to decrypt the encrypted String,
it may be easier to split the String into two Strings, one String of all the letters encrypted with
key1â€‹and one String of all the letters encrypted with key2.â€‹Then use the algorithm from the
lesson to determine the key for each String, and then use those keys and the two key
encryption method to decrypt the original encrypted message.
For example, if the encrypted message was â€œQbkm Zgisâ€, then you would split this String into
two Strings: â€œQk gsâ€, representing the characters in the odd number positions and â€œbmZiâ€
representing the characters in the even number positions. Then you would get the key for each
half String and use the two key encryption method to find the message. Note this example is so
small it likely wonâ€™t find the keys, but it illustrates how to take the Strings apart.
A sample file to test your program that is small with lots of eâ€™s is called wordsLotsOfEs.txtâ€‹and
shown here:
Just a test string with lots of eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
And the same file encrypted using keys 23 and 2 is called wordsLotsOfEsEncrypted.txtâ€‹and is
shown here:
Gwpv c vbuq pvokki yfve iqqu qc bgbgbgbgbgbgbgbgbu
Specifically, you should do the following.
â— Complete the decryption method shown in the lesson by creating a CaesarBreaker class
with the methods countLetters,â€‹maxIndex,â€‹and decrypt.â€‹Recall that the decrypt
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
method creates a CaesarCipher object in order to use the encryptâ€‹method you wrote for
the last lesson. Make sure that your CaesarCipher class is in the same folder as
CaesarBreaker! You may want to use the following code as part of your decrypt
method.
CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher()Í¾
String message = cc.encrypt(encrypted, 26 Â­ key)Í¾
Write a testDecrypt â€‹method in the CaesarBreaker class that prints the decrypted
message, and make sure it works for encrypted messages that were encrypted with one
key.
â— Write the method halfOfStringâ€‹in the CaesarBreaker class that has two parameters, a
String parameter named messageâ€‹and an int parameter named startâ€‹. This method
should return a new String that is every other character from message starting with the
start position. For example, the call halfOfString(â€œQbkm Zgisâ€, 0)returns the
String â€œQk gsâ€and the call halfOfString(â€œQbkm Zgisâ€, 1) returns the String
â€œbmZiâ€. Be sure to test this method with a small example.
â— Write the method getKeyâ€‹in the CaesarBreaker class that has one parameter, a String sâ€‹.
This method should call countLettersâ€‹to get an array of the letter frequencies in String s
and then use maxIndexâ€‹to calculate the index of the largest letter frequency, which is
the location of the encrypted letter â€?eâ€™, which leads to the key, which is returned.
â— Write the method decryptTwoKeysâ€‹in the CaesarBreaker class that has one parameter,
a String parameter named encryptedâ€‹that represents a String that was encrypted with
the two key algorithm discussed in the previous lesson. This method attempts to
determine the two keys used to encrypt the message, prints the two keys, and then
returns the decrypted String with those two keys. More specifically, this method should:
â—‹ Calculate a String of every other character starting with the first character of the
encrypted String by calling halfOfString.â€‹
â—‹ Calculate a String of every other character starting with the second character of
the encrypted String.
â—‹ Then calculate the key used to encrypt each half String.
Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
â—‹ You should print the two keys found.
â—‹ Calculate and return the decrypted String using the encryptTwoKeysâ€‹method
from your CaesarCipher class, again making sure it is in the same folder as your
CaesarBreaker class.*/
